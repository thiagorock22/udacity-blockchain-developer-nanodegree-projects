## Project overview

In this project, you’ll create and manage your **blockchain identity** using a bitcoin wallet.

Using your wallet, you will generate a new wallet address and use your wallet address to securely sign a message with your private key. Next, validate your message with your message signature using our web service.

## Why this project?

This project introduces you to the **fundamentals of blockchain technology**.

Using your own wallet to understand how transactions and security are handled on the blockchain is a huge first step toward developing your own secure applications. Later in this program, you’ll be programming blockchain technologies that utilize these same features.

## What will I learn?

You will learn to create and **manage your personal blockchain identity**. You’ll get first hand experience generating wallet address and interacting with a web service to create your blockchain identity.

This project helps build on the skills you learned in Lesson 1 and Lesson 2. You will apply these skills using real world technologies to get hands on with the tools used to manage blockchain transactions and identities.

## How does this help my career?

Understanding wallet and web service interactions using a wallet address will help you build user applications later in the program. Secure and anonymous transactions like these are at the core of all blockchain technologies.
